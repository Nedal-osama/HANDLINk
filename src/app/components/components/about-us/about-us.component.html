          <h3>Our Innovation</h3>
          <p>
            This project uses cutting-edge AI technology to convert images of
             hand gestures from the American Finger Spelling alphabet into readable
              text. It provides an easy and efficient way to translate sign language into text,
               promoting better communication for the hearing impaired.

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is to create a tool that facilitates communication between individuals
             who use sign language and those who don't. This system helps users understand and
              translate sign language gestures, making conversations smoother and more inclusive.

          <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
          <p>
            The ability to understand sign language is crucial for inclusivity,
             but tools for real-time translation are limited. Our project offers a simple
              and effective solution to convert sign language gestures into text in real-time.

          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p>
            The system uses advanced image recognition powered by machine learning.
             Users upload or capture a sign language image, and our AI processes and
              converts it into accurate text.
